UPDATE: Please go to this link to view my final report https://reinalynn.github.io/MSDS692/Final_Report.html

My goal is to forecast COVID-19 cases and deaths at the country level for the US, at the state level for key states (MN, CO, TX, and a few others that I have yet to identify) and at the county level for specific counties in my home state (Minnesota). I have observed the growth of COVID in my community and would like to better identity where we are in our local surge. Because I work for the mid-sized healthcare system that handles all testing and hospitalizations for a 12-county area here in central MN, I am also aware of unique factors such as increased testing at our local meat processing plant and the census data for the system, including the number of positive cases at each healthcare facility.
